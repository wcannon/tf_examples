Items that need updating or implementation

- Tighten  up S3 iam policy for the acme user
- Confirm logging is happening

- Review code and add comments to code where needed
- Review usage of S3 access points for further usage
- Use "logical directories" for sftp users and chroot them in their directory

Company specific
- use data lookups for vpc, subnet info
- update for needed changes to pass sentinel policies
